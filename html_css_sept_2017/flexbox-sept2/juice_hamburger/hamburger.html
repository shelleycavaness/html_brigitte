                 <p>"Fruit juice isn't the same as intact fruit and it has as much sugar as many classical sugar drinks," said Jebb, who has stopped drinking juice. "It is also absorbed very fast, so by the time it gets to your stomach your body doesn't know whether it's Coca-Cola or orange juice, frankly. I have to say it is a relatively easy thing to give up. Swap it and have a piece of real fruit. If you are going to drink it, you should dilute it."</p>

                  <p>This comes on top of a year or so of stories about the high sugar content of fruit juice. The same US scientists who warned about the use of high-fructose corn syrup in fizzy drinks have now turned their attention to juice. "Fruit juice and smoothies are the new danger," Barry Popkin, professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, told the Guardian in September. </p>

                        <p>So why is fruit juice still being pushed as a healthy option? "You can't trust government health advice," says Joanna Blythman, author of What to Eat. "They have the same advice that they've been recycling for 50 years and rarely change it. It's embarrassing to admit they've made a mistake."</p>

                    <p> the Bitter Truth about Sugar received much attention last year – and studies such as one published in the British Medical Journal in the summer, which found fruit juice is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, are starting to make people realise that fruit juice may not be as wholesome as they once believed.</p>
